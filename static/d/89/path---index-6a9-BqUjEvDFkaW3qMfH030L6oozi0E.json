I changed careers, homes, added family members and finally became a software engineer.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Testing adding a second paragraph here.</p>\n<h2>Professional</h2>\n<p>In January, I finally left Think Shift, the agency that had been my professional home for almost 7 years. It was hard to leave - I had a lot of great friends and several mentors who had helped me gain the career that I’d had. But I could also feel myself hitting a ceiling.</p>\n<p>What’s more, I didn’t just leave Think Shift for another job - I left Think Shift for an entirely different career.</p>\n<p>I joined Alchemy Code Lab in February for a five month, full-time JavaScript bootcamp. It was one of the most terrifying things I’ve ever done. I remember walking into the class on my first day (20 minutes early, a good habit I’d developed at Think Shift), looking around and wondering what in the hell I was doing.</p>\n<p>I graduated from Alchemy Code Lab in June and immediately went home to spend a week with my family in Ohio. They had a lot of questions: “So, where are you interviewing? Do you think you’ll have a job soon?”</p>\n<p>In August, I interviewed for a full-time position at InVision. I was so excited to work for them that I threw out anything - I was happy to take an internship, either paid or unpaid.</p>\n<h2>Community</h2>\n<p>At the end of 2016, I started attending more Women Who Code events in an effort to get to know the people that I would soon be working with. Toward the beginning of the year, I wanted to see the movie <em>Hidden Figures</em>, but didn’t have anyone who would go with me. So I posted in the Women Who Code slack channel:</p>\n<p>“Anyone want to go see Hidden Figures on Jan. 12?”</p>\n<p>Caterina asked me if I would like to host an event. So, I thought, why not?</p>\n<p>Caterina asked me to join the WWC leadership team in February, and I eagerly accepted. Starting in January of 2018, I am now the Open Source Lead for Women Who Code.</p>\n<h2>Personal</h2>\n<p>In September of 2016, Dave and I tied the knot after being together for 6 years. When I was about to leave Think Shift at the beginning of the year, we had several very serious and very heavy conversations. How would we manage going from a two income household to a single income one?</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"2017 Year In Review","path":"/review-of-2017/","category":"Personal","tags":["Year In Review"],"description":null,"date":"2018/01/13","image":null}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>It’s been a while since I updated this site, and I want to get better about charting out my accomplishments and keeping up with my React coding.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>So, this week, I:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Set up a Windows CI/CD pipeline</li>\n<li>Wrote a risk assessment answer doc for our security team</li>\n<li>Figured out how to debug my functional tests not working after about 4 hours and several days of Googling - was is Robot.js, part of Electron’s framework?

Then, in an open source project, we used yet another framework - Hapi.</p>\n<p>I’ve seen each of the three before (and used Koa lightly for a small app in the past), but didn’t know much about their differences, or why a project should choose one over the others. So today, we’re going to whip up a few very basic servers and routes to check out the differences between the three.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Before we do that, though, let’s start with the basics:</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>What is a framework?</h3>\n<p>A ‘framework’ is a bit of a suitcase word - it can mean a few different things depending on the context and the application, but is always a supporting structure for an application. In Node, when we say ‘framework’, we’re talking about a structure that lets us build a REST API or otherwise make server connections without having to write a lot of the middleware involved.</p>\n<p>So when we’re evaluating frameworks, we’re looking at:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How performant they are (Are they fast? Do they have a lot of middleware that we won’t use that might add bloat?)</li>\n<li>What features they do and don’t support (Is async/await supported or built in?)</li>\n<li>Do I (the developer) like them (this is wildly subjective, but hell, what’s software without strong opinions about subjective issues?)</li>\n</ol>\n<hr>\n<h3>Basic Comparision</h3>\n<p>Below is a quick summary of each framework, as well as really basic server code, so we can see their similarities and differences:</p>\n<h4>Express</h4>\n<p>Express is the most popular framework for Node by far.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> express <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">require</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'express'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> app <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">express</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token constant\">PORT</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> process<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>env<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token constant\">PORT</span> <span class=\"token operator\">||</span> <span class=\"token number\">3000</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> server <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> app<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">listen</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token constant\">PORT</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token string\">`Express is listening to http://localhost:</span><span class=\"token interpolation\"><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">${</span><span class=\"token constant\">PORT</span><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token string\">`</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>The above probably looks very familiar if you’re a node developer.

Essentally you just required koa instead of express. We even have the same <code class=\"language-text\">app.listen()</code> wrapper function.</p>\n<p>What makes Koa truly standout - and what actually led to me working with it - is its way to ditch callback completely by either using ES6 function generators or the newer async/await control flow. It also eliminates much of the middleware that Express uses.</p>\n<p>Generators are new to JavaScript, but had been used in other languages; one person comapred them to <code class=\"language-text\">interruption</code> in C. Generators introduced a means to run -> halt and run something else -> come back.</p>\n<p>Koa 1 is famous for supporting generator-based control out of the box, at a time when most frameworks didn’t. This is what a typical piece of code for Koa 1 that uses the middleware cascading and improved error handling looks like:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Taken from https://github.com/koajs/koa</span>\napp<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">use</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span><span class=\"token operator\">*</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>next<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// generator signified by *</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">try</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">yield</span> next\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">catch</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token class-name\">err</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>body <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> message<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> err<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>message <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>status <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> err<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>status <span class=\"token operator\">||</span> <span class=\"token number\">500</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\napp<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">use</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">function</span><span class=\"token operator\">*</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>next<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> user <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">yield</span> User<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getById</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>session<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>id<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">this</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>body <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> user\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>I was confused, however, when I was reading the Koa docs and didn’t see any generators in the documentation. It turns out that Koa 2 (the current version) removes built-in support for generators and uses async functions instead. The signature of middleware functions will change to support async arrow functions.</p>\n<p>Here’s the same code as above, but written for Koa 2:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token comment\">// Taken from https://github.com/koajs/koa</span>\napp<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">use</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">async</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>ctx<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> next<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token operator\">></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">try</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">await</span> <span class=\"token function\">next</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">catch</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token class-name\">err</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    ctx<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>body <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> message<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> err<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>message <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    ctx<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>status <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> err<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>status <span class=\"token operator\">||</span> <span class=\"token number\">500</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\napp<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">use</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token keyword\">async</span> ctx <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> user <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">await</span> User<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getById</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>ctx<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>session<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>id<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  ctx<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>body <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> user<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>From what I can tell, adoption of the async/await control flow is now the standard over ES6 generators.

the async/await control flow, rather than the generator control flow. The handling is fairly different; I thought <a href=\"https://github.com/koajs/koa/blob/master/docs/koa-vs-express.md\">Koa’s docs</a> did a nice job of stating the difference for Express users:</p>\n<p>*Philosophically, Koa aims to “fix and replace node”, whereas Express “augments node”. Koa uses promises and async functions to rid apps of callback hell and simplify error handling. It exposes its own ctx.request and ctx.response objects instead of node’s req and res objects.</p>\n<p>Express, on the other hand, augments node’s req and res objects with additional properties and methods and includes many other “framework” features, such as routing and templating, which Koa does not.*</p>\n<h3>Hapi</h3>\n<p><em>(As a quick aside: Hapi is the server that I have worked with the least and the one that I had to do the most reading about. I’d be happy to be corrected or have clarification on anything written here.)</em></p>\n<p>Hapi is a bit more robust than either Express or Koa. It’s a “feature rich framework” (as described in the docs) that favors configuration over code and attempts to cover a wider ranger of use cases out of the box. It was originally created by a member of WalmartLabs, and it is intended for large teams and large projects. Because of this, it can be a bit boilerplate-heavy for small projects.</p>\n<p>Let’s set up our server:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> Hapi <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">require</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'hapi'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token constant\">PORT</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> process<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>env<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token constant\">PORT</span> <span class=\"token operator\">||</span> <span class=\"token number\">3000</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> server <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">Hapi<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>Server</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token constant\">PORT</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n\nserver<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">start</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token string\">`Hapi is listening to http://localhost:</span><span class=\"token interpolation\"><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">${</span><span class=\"token constant\">PORT</span><span class=\"token interpolation-punctuation punctuation\">}</span></span><span class=\"token string\">`</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span></code></pre></div>\n<p>Right away, you can see unique things in Hapi’s code. Look at the first few lines: <code class=\"language-text\">hapi</code> is required, but instead of instantiating a hapi app, you create a new Server and specify the port. In Express and Koa, we get a callback function; in Hapi, we get a new server object.</p>\n<p>When we call <code class=\"language-text\">server.start()</code>, we start the server on port 3000 which then returns a callback. It’s not a wrapper around <code class=\"language-text\">http.CreateServer()</code>; it’s using it’s own logic.</p>\n<p>Where we can really see the differences between Hapi and the other two frameworks, though, is in the routing. Let’s write some basic REST routes for a fake music REST API, similar to Express above:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\"><pre class=\"language-js\"><code

Hapi’s configuration-centric approach does tend to mean more boilerplate, and that can make it more error prone.</p>\n<p>That’s not to say that more boilerplate is always a bad thing; for larger teams, for example, Hapi may be more consistent and self-descriptive and thus easier to read and parse. I also know a several Node developers who like to have the extra control over their code, and so prefer to write out the methods and handlers this way. I don’t think it’s personally for me, but to each their own!</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>In summary:</p>\n<p>Express: Lightweight and minimalist, supported by most middleware, seems to be the defacto standard.</p>\n<p>Koa: Great async/await support for asynchronous flow. Seems to be ‘the new hottness’.</p>\n<p>Hapi: Great for larger scale projects out of the box, but has some extra middleware to deal with.</p>\n<p>I see myself continuing to use Express in the future, but would really like to do more with Koa, as I really like the new async/await control flow and see us generally moving in that direction. In the future, I’d also like to explore Socket.io, Sails and Meteor, which all seem to be quite popular.</p>\n<hr>\n<h3>Bibliography:</h3>\n<p>If you’d like a few more resources on the difference between Node frameworks, here are a few articles that I read while writing this blog post.

Half of my job was managing projects and people as we crafted new branding and communcations plans; the other half was moderating workshops with executive teams to assure them that, no, they weren’t dysfunctional and yes, we could help communicate a broader message during change initiatives.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>During my tenure at my old firm, we used several abstractions that we called “tools” to encapsulate ways that teams of people could better understand each other and communicate more effectively.</p>\n<p>One of my favorite tools was a tool called “Speak to Think”. This tool was meant to show two different styles of communication, and how a person could help themselves be more easily understood in a group discussion. I’ve found it to be incredibly useful to think about when I need to communicate during a pairing session. </p>\n<p>Here’s the basic overview. Essentially, a person’s natural comfort zone for communication can fall into one of two buckets:</p>\n<h3>Speak to Think</h3>\n<p>“Speak to Think” personalities do their best mental processing aloud - whether that means pacing the room, talking out their problems (or rubber-ducking), or just typing and deleting code, a “speak to think” personality thinks best when emoting. </p>\n<p>I personally a more “speak to think” coder; I’m the sort of person who needs to put garbage or psuedo-code into my IDE and mess with it to comeup with a coherent solution. I noticed, during my early pairing sessions, that this was irritating to colleagues or just confusing, because they couldn’t tell which code was meant to be permanent and which was just my mental musings writ small. So, now I tend to say before I start typing:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Okay - sorry if this is odd, but I personally think best when I can type things out and see the code, even if it’s just psuedo-code and not actually syntacically correct. Do you mind if I start putting some stuff down and we can throw rocks at it? Not at all meant to be final, it just helps me process what we’re trying to solve.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>99.9% of the time, the person agrees and we can go through it together. Just that simple act of being intentional and communicating your actions goes a long way. I know this sounds mind-numbingly obvious, but when you’re in a stressful situation or deep in a code problem, it can be easy to climb into your own head and start communicating poorly. I try to very intentionally say what I’m doing and what my intentions are, so my partner is on the same level.</p>\n<h3>Think to Speak</h3>\n<p>A person who “thinks to speak” is the opposite of a “speak to think” person, in that they prefer to solve the problem in their head or fully complete the thought before communicating or writing it. </p>\n<p>I’ve paired with several of these people during my bootcamp, and would run into a similar situation: each time during our pairing session, there would be a period of time where the individual would stop typing, sit and stare at the computer silently for about a minute. They would say nothing to me, and give no indication of what they were thinking. As a very emotive thinker, I would get antsy during these long periods of sudden silence, wanting to start typing or start talking or just make sure I was working on the same problem as they were.</p>\n<p>There’s nothing at all wrong with being a “think to speak” developer! Some of the most intelligent people that I’ve worked with in my career have this mentality - a favorite old boss was very “think to speak”. Just make sure that you’re intentional about communicating with your teams or your pairing colleague when you need this time, so that they’re tracking with you. Even something as simple as this:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So I’m the kind of person who really likes to think it out before I start putting anything down, so I might just need a minute to sit here silently and take everything in before I can start talking this out with you. Is that cool? I’ll let you know when I’m done, it won’t take too long, and then we can start working.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Mentally, this will do two things: it will put your partner at ease, because they better understand what you need and what you need from them, and it will give you an uninterrupted period in which you can do your thinking. Perfect!</p>\n<h3>Hybrid styles under stress</h3>\n<p>It’s rare that people are purely one way or another in how they process information and solve problems. Most of the people you meet will be some hybrid variation of the above two styles, reacting in different ways depending on the subject matter and environment.</p>\n<p>Working in tech is a very stressful environment, and I’ve noticed that these patterns of behavior will get especially pronounced under stress. If I’m working on a very difficult problem, I’ve caught myself doing a very bad job of communicating with my partner - I’ll start changing code, trying to break things and testing different syntax, leaving my partner wondering what the hell I’m doing or thinking. Conversely, I may stop entirely and say nothing for a long period of time or give a distracted response because I’m very deep in my own head trying to solve one part of a problem - while my partner is trying to solve a different problem entirely.</p>\n<p>Communication hiccups are normal during a pairing session, especially with two junior developers trying to solve an advanced problem. What I find helpful is to look for these triggers, and remind myself to take 30 seconds to communicate clearly and explain that any reactions I might be having are from my learning style, and not a deficiency of my partner.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"Communication Styles and Learning","path":"/communication-styles/","category":"Technical","tags":["Soft Skills"],"description":null,"date":"2017/05/26","image":null}}},{"post":{"html":"<figcaption>Johannes Gutenberg</figcaption>\n<p>His invention of mechanical movable type printing started the Printing Revolution and is widely regarded as the most important event of the modern period. It played a key role in the development of the Renaissance, Reformation, the Age of Enlightenment, and the Scientific revolution and laid the material basis for the modern knowledge-based economy and the spread of learning to the masses.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>With his invention of the printing press, Gutenberg was the first European to use movable type printing, in around 1439. Among his many contributions to printing are: the invention of a process for mass-producing movable type; the use of oil-based ink; and the use of a wooden printing press similar to the agricultural screw presses of the period. His truly epochal invention was the combination of these elements into a practical system that allowed the mass production of printed books and was economically viable for printers and readers alike. Gutenberg’s method for making type is traditionally considered to have included a type metal alloy and a hand mould for casting type. The alloy was a mixture of lead, tin, and antimony that melted at a relatively low temperature for faster and more economical casting, cast well, and created a durable type.</p>\n<p>In Renaissance Europe, the arrival of mechanical movable type printing introduced the era of mass communication which permanently altered the structure of society. The relatively unrestricted circulation of information — including revolutionary ideas — transcended borders, captured the masses in the Reformation and threatened the power of political and religious authorities; the sharp increase in literacy broke the monopoly of the literate elite on education and learning and bolstered the emerging middle class. Across Europe, the increasing cultural self-awareness of its people led to the rise of proto-nationalism, accelerated by the flowering of the European vernacular languages to the detriment of Latin’s status as lingua franca. In the 19th century, the replacement of the hand-operated Gutenberg-style press by steam-powered rotary presses allowed printing on an industrial scale, while Western-style printing was adopted all over the world, becoming practically the sole medium for modern bulk printing.</p>\n<p>The use of movable type was a marked improvement on the handwritten manuscript, which was the existing method of book production in Europe, and upon woodblock printing, and revolutionized European book-making. Gutenberg’s printing technology spread rapidly throughout Europe and later the world.</p>\n<p>His major work, the Gutenberg Bible (also known as the 42-line Bible), has been acclaimed for its high aesthetic and technical quality.</p>\n<h2>Printing Press</h2>\n<p>Around 1439, Gutenberg was involved in a financial misadventure making polished metal mirrors (which were believed to capture holy light from religious relics) for sale to pilgrims to Aachen: in 1439 the city was planning to exhibit its collection of relics from Emperor Charlemagne but the event was delayed by one year due to a severe flood and the capital already spent could not be repaid. When the question of satisfying the investors came up, Gutenberg is said to have promised to share a “secret”. It has been widely speculated that this secret may have been the idea of printing with movable type. Also around 1439–1440, the Dutch Laurens Janszoon Coster came up with the idea of printing. Legend has it that the idea came to him “like a ray of light”.</p>\n\n  <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem;; max-width: 750px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 128.91246684350133%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\">\n      <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"Early Printing Press\" title=\"\" src=\"/static/Printing-press-9ec265253f068855f00558a9be7f3e03-245fd.png\" srcset=\"/static/Printing-press-9ec265253f068855f00558a9be7f3e03-7aee9.png 188w,\n/static/Printing-press-9ec265253f068855f00558a9be7f3e03-2014b.png 375w,\n/static/Printing-press-9ec265253f068855f00558a9be7f3e03-245fd.png 750w,\n/static/Printing-press-9ec265253f068855f00558a9be7f3e03-21a9b.png 754w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px\">\n    </span>\n  </span>\n  \n<figcaption>Early wooden printing press as depicted in 1568.</figcaption>\n<p>Until at least 1444 he lived in Strasbourg, most likely in the St. Arbogast parish. It was in Strasbourg in 1440 that Gutenberg is said to have perfected and unveiled the secret of printing based on his research, mysteriously entitled Kunst und Aventur (art and enterprise). It is not clear what work he was engaged in, or whether some early trials with printing from movable type may have been conducted there. After this, there is a gap of four years in the record. In 1448, he was back in Mainz, where he took out a loan from his brother-in-law Arnold Gelthus, quite possibly for a printing press or related paraphernalia. By this date, Gutenberg may have been familiar with intaglio printing; it is claimed that he had worked on copper engravings with an artist known as the Master of Playing Cards.</p>\n<p>By 1450, the press was in operation, and a German poem had been printed, possibly the first item to be printed there. Gutenberg was able to convince the wealthy moneylender Johann Fust for a loan of 800 guilders. Peter Schöffer, who became Fust’s son-in-law, also joined the enterprise. Schöffer had worked as a scribe in Paris and is believed to have designed some of the first typefaces.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>All that has been written to me about that marvelous man seen at Frankfurt is true. I have not seen complete Bibles but only a number of quires of various books of the Bible. The script was very neat and legible, not at all difficult to follow—your grace would be able to read it without effort, and indeed without glasses.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>—Future pope Pius II in a letter to Cardinal Carvajal, March 1455</p>\n<p>Gutenberg’s workshop was set up at Hof Humbrecht, a property belonging to a distant relative. It is not clear when Gutenberg conceived the Bible project, but for this he borrowed another 800 guilders from Fust, and work commenced in 1452. At the same time, the press was also printing other, more lucrative texts (possibly Latin grammars). There is also some speculation that there may have been two presses, one for the pedestrian texts, and one for the Bible. One of the profit-making enterprises of the new press was the printing of thousands of indulgences for the church, documented from 1454–55.</p>\n<p>In 1455 Gutenberg completed his 42-line Bible, known as the Gutenberg Bible. About 180 copies were printed, most on paper and some on vellum.</p>\n<h2>Court Case</h2>\n<p>Some time in 1456, there was a dispute between Gutenberg and Fust, and Fust demanded his money back, accusing Gutenberg of misusing the funds. Meanwhile the expenses of the Bible project had proliferated, and Gutenberg’s debt now exceeded 20,000 guilders. Fust sued at the archbishop’s court. A November 1455 legal document records that there was a partnership for a “project of the books,” the funds for which Gutenberg had used for other purposes, according to Fust. The court decided in favor of Fust, giving him control over the Bible printing workshop and half of all printed Bibles.</p>\n<p>Thus Gutenberg was effectively bankrupt, but it appears he retained (or re-started) a small printing shop, and participated in the printing of a Bible in the town of Bamberg around 1459, for which he seems at least to have supplied the type. But since his printed books never carry his name or a date, it is difficult to be certain, and there is consequently a considerable scholarly debate on this subject. It is also possible that the large Catholicon dictionary, 300 copies of 754 pages, printed in Mainz in 1460, may have been executed in his workshop.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Fust–Schöffer shop was the first in Europe to bring out a book with the printer’s name and date, the Mainz Psalter of August 1457, and while proudly proclaiming the mechanical process by which it had been produced, it made no mention of Gutenberg.</p>\n<h2>Later Life</h2>\n<p>In 1462, during a conflict between two archbishops, Mainz was sacked by archbishop Adolph von Nassau, and Gutenberg was exiled. An old man by now, he moved to Eltville where he may have initiated and supervised a new printing press belonging to the brothers Bechtermünze.</p>\n<p>In January 1465, Gutenberg’s achievements were recognized and he was given the title Hofmann (gentleman of the court) by von Nassau. This honor included a stipend, an annual court outfit, as well as 2,180 litres of grain and 2,000 litres of wine tax-free. It is believed he may have moved back to Mainz around this time, but this is not certain.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Gutenberg died in 1468 and was buried in the Franciscan church at Mainz, his contributions largely unknown. This church and the cemetery were later destroyed, and Gutenberg’s grave is now lost.</p>\n<p>In 1504, he was mentioned as the inventor of typography in a book by Professor Ivo Wittig. It was not until 1567 that the first portrait of Gutenberg, almost certainly an imaginary reconstruction, appeared in Heinrich Pantaleon’s biography of famous Germans.</p>\n<h2>Printing Method With Movable Type</h2>\n<p>Gutenberg’s early printing process, and what tests he may have made with movable type, are not known in great detail. His later Bibles were printed in such a way as to have required large quantities of type, some estimates suggesting as many as 100,000 individual sorts. Setting each page would take, perhaps, half a day, and considering all the work in loading the press, inking the type, pulling the impressions, hanging up the sheets, distributing the type, etc., it is thought that the Gutenberg–Fust shop might have employed as many as 25 craftsmen.</p>\n<p>\n  <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-bottom: 1.0725rem;; max-width: 750px; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 66.43356643356644%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    >\n      <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width: 100%; height: 100%; margin: 0; vertical-align: middle; position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; box-shadow: inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"Movable metal type, and composing stick, descended from Gutenberg's press.

Photo by Willi Heidelbach. Licensed under CC BY 2.5</em></p>\n<p>Gutenberg’s technique of making movable type remains unclear. In the following decades, punches and copper matrices became standardized in the rapidly disseminating printing presses across Europe. Whether Gutenberg used this sophisticated technique or a somewhat primitive version has been the subject of considerable debate.</p>\n<p>In the standard process of making type, a hard metal punch (made by punchcutting, with the letter carved back to front) is hammered into a softer copper bar, creating a matrix. This is then placed into a hand-held mould and a piece of type, or “sort”, is cast by filling the mould with molten type-metal; this cools almost at once, and the resulting piece of type can be removed from the mould. The matrix can be reused to create hundreds, or thousands, of identical sorts so that the same character appearing anywhere within the book will appear very uniform, giving rise, over time, to the development of distinct styles of typefaces or fonts. After casting, the sorts are arranged into type-cases, and used to make up pages which are inked and printed, a procedure which can be repeated hundreds, or thousands, of times. The sorts can be reused in any combination, earning the process the name of “movable type”.</p>\n<p>The invention of the making of types with punch, matrix and mold has been widely attributed to Gutenberg. However, recent evidence suggests that Gutenberg’s process was somewhat different. If he used the punch and matrix approach, all his letters should have been nearly identical, with some variations due to miscasting and inking. However, the type used in Gutenberg’s earliest work shows other variations.</p>\n<figure>\n\t<blockquote>\n\t\t<p>It is a press, certainly, but a press from which shall flow in inexhaustible streams… Through it, god will spread his word.</p>\n\t\t<footer>\n\t\t\t<cite>—Johannes Gutenberg</cite>\n\t\t</footer>\n\t</blockquote>\n</figure>\n<p>In 2001, the physicist Blaise Agüera y Arcas and Princeton librarian Paul Needham, used digital scans of a Papal bull in the Scheide Library, Princeton, to carefully compare the same letters (types) appearing in different parts of the printed text. The irregularities in Gutenberg’s type, particularly in simple characters such as the hyphen, suggested that the variations could not have come from either ink smear or from wear and damage on the pieces of metal on the types themselves. While some identical types are clearly used on other pages, other variations, subjected to detailed image analysis, suggested that they could not have been produced from the same matrix. Transmitted light pictures of the page also appeared to reveal substructures in the type that could not arise from traditional punchcutting techniques. They hypothesized that the method may have involved impressing simple shapes to create alphabets in “cuneiform” style in a matrix made of some soft material, perhaps sand. Casting the type would destroy the mould, and the matrix would need to be recreated to make each additional sort. This could explain the variations in the type, as well as the substructures observed in the printed images.</p>\n<p>Thus, they feel that “the decisive factor for the birth of typography”, the use of reusable moulds for casting type, might have been a more progressive process than was previously thought. They suggest that the additional step of using the punch to create a mould that could be reused many times was not taken until twenty years later, in the 1470s. Others have not accepted some or all of their suggestions, and have interpreted the evidence in other ways, and the truth of the matter remains very uncertain.</p>\n<p>A 1568 history by Hadrianus Junius of Holland claims that the basic idea of the movable type came to Gutenberg from Laurens Janszoon Coster via Fust, who was apprenticed to Coster in the 1430s and may have brought some of his equipment from Haarlem to Mainz. While Coster appears to have experimented with moulds and castable metal type, there is no evidence that he had actually printed anything with this technology. He was an inventor and a goldsmith. However, there is one indirect supporter of the claim that Coster might be the inventor. The author of the Cologne Chronicle of 1499 quotes Ulrich Zell, the first printer of Cologne, that printing was performed in Mainz in 1450, but that some type of printing of lower quality had previously occurred in the Netherlands. However, the chronicle does not mention the name of Coster, while it actually credits Gutenberg as the “first inventor of printing” in the very same passage (fol. 312). The first securely dated book by Dutch printers is from 1471, and the Coster connection is today regarded as a mere legend.</p>\n<p>The 19th century printer and typefounder Fournier Le Jeune suggested that Gutenberg might not have been using type cast with a reusable matrix, but possibly wooden types that were carved individually. A similar suggestion was made by Nash in 2004. This remains possible, albeit entirely unproven.</p>\n<p>It has also been questioned whether Gutenberg used movable types at all. In 2004, Italian professor Bruno Fabbiani claimed that examination of the 42-line Bible revealed an overlapping of letters, suggesting that Gutenberg did not in fact use movable type (individual cast characters) but rather used whole plates made from a system somewhat like a modern typewriter, whereby the letters were stamped successively into the plate and then printed. However, most specialists regard the occasional overlapping of type as caused by paper movement over pieces of type of slightly unequal height.</p>\n<h2>Legacy</h2>\n<p>Although Gutenberg was financially unsuccessful in his lifetime, the printing technologies spread quickly, and news and books began to travel across Europe much faster than before. It fed the growing Renaissance, and since it greatly facilitated scientific publishing, it was a major catalyst for the later scientific revolution.</p>\n<p>The capital of printing in Europe shifted to Venice, where visionary printers like Aldus Manutius ensured widespread availability of the major Greek and Latin texts. The claims of an Italian origin for movable type have also focused on this rapid rise of Italy in movable-type printing. This may perhaps be explained by the prior eminence of Italy in the paper and printing trade. Additionally, Italy’s economy was growing rapidly at the time, facilitating the spread of literacy. Christopher Columbus had a geographical book (printed by movable types) bought by his father. That book is in a Spanish museum. Finally, the city of Mainz was sacked in 1462, driving many (including a number of printers and punch cutters) into exile.</p>\n<p>Printing was also a factor in the Reformation. Martin Luther’s 95 Theses were printed and circulated widely; subsequently he issued broadsheets outlining his anti-indulgences position (certificates of indulgences were one of the first items Gutenberg had printed). The broadsheet contributed to development of the newspaper.</p>\n<p>In the decades after Gutenberg, many conservative patrons looked down on cheap printed books; books produced by hand were considered more desirable.</p>\n<p>Today there is a large antique market for the earliest printed objects. Books printed prior to 1500 are known as incunabula.</p>","frontmatter":{"layout":"post","title":"The Birth of Movable Type","path":"/hello-world/","category":"Typography","tags":["Movable Type","Johannes Gutenberg"],"description":"Johannes Gensfleisch zur Laden zum Gutenberg (c. 1398 – 1468) was a German blacksmith, goldsmith, printer, and publisher who introduced printing to Europe.","date":"2016/03/01","image":{"childImageSharp":{"fixed":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","width":374,"height":480,"src":"/static/Gutenberg-3e20438298edd3a3fa746766d803f379-0b311.jpg","srcSet":"/static/Gutenberg-3e20438298edd3a3fa746766d803f379-0b311.jpg 1x","srcWebp":"/static/Gutenberg-3e20438298edd3a3fa746766d803f379-2a741.webp","srcSetWebp":"/static/Gutenberg-3e20438298edd3a3fa746766d803f379-2a741.webp 1x"}}}}}},{"post":{"html":"<p>Paragraphs are separated by a blank line.</p>\n<p>2nd paragraph. <em>Italic</em>, <strong>bold</strong>, and <code class=\"language-text\">monospace</code>.
