It’s going to be a busy week this week - my father is coming to visit on Tuesday, I’m traveling to Seattle on business for Tuesday &#x26; Wednesday, and my birthday is on Thursday. So this will just be a quick reminder of events happening.</p>\n<!--more-->\n<p>Here’s what’s going on in Portland this week and next week:</p>\n<h3>Events</h3>\n<p>If you’re in PDX tech:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Portland-ReactJS/events/241125197/\">Tues, 7/11: Portland ReactJS Lighting Talks and Hack Night.</a> Portland ReactJS is holding a monthly lightning talk and presentation night at New Relic.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/pdxnode/events/238627202/\">Thurs, 7/13: PDXNode Presentation Night.</a> So bummed that I can’t attend this week, but if you’re free, you should.
