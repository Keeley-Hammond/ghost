Happy Monday! 

Thursday's Wieden+Kennedy event was a smashing success. We had great VR demos with Unity, an LED wearable workshop led by engineers of the Lodge team and a donut photo booth: a booth that printed sugar-spun icing photos onto donuts, letting you eat your own face.

Thanks so much to the ladies of W+K and Women Who Code who made everything possible- and who sang "Happy Birthday" to me at the end of the event.

Here's what's going on in Portland this week and next week:

### Events

If you're in PDX tech:
* [Tues, 7/18: Design and Product Study Night.](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/events/240763387/) Our product and design study night meets once per month at New Relic. Come share your portfolio and work on side projects with others!
* [Thurs, 7/26: JavaScript Study Night.](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/events/240373631/) The Javascript study night is always one of my favorite Women Who Code study nights. This week, we'll be working through a Wes Bos tutorial and pairing on any existing projects. 
* [Thurs, 7/27: PDX Node Hack Night.](https://www.meetup.com/pdxnode/events/241094722/) PDXNode Hack Nights are your opportunity to enjoy a low-pressure JavaScript-centric environment where you shouldn't feel like you're supposed to do anything. Hang, hack, learn, or do whatever youâ€™re interested in doing. ðŸ™Œ 

While not happening this week, I also wanted to give a shout out to two upcoming longer-form conferences:


* [August 8-9: Alexa Skills Tour, Powered by Voicehacks.](https://www.voicehacks.com/tour/portland) Throwing this out there now, as the first 100 registrations are free. The two day workshop will cover how to design, build, and launch skills for Alexa.

### Non-Tech Events: 

Promoting my usual two running meetups; if you need a crew of people to run with, come join us:
