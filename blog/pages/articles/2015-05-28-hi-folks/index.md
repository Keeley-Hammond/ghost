Happy Monday! I just got back from a nice week with the family; visiting my parents, brothers, sister and dog. 

It was a balmy 80* in Akron, and being greeted by 100+* weather here in PDX was far from welcome. Fortunately, Dave and I took a trip to Cape Falcon on the coast, and got away from the heat for a bit.

Here's what's going on in Portland this week:

### Events

If you're in PDX tech:
* [Tues, 6/27: Donut JS.](https://donutjs.club/) Donut JS has some excellent speakers lined up this week, and tickets are still available (reminder: if you're a Women Who Code PDX member, you can come for free!).
* [Wed, 6/28: Javascript Study Night.](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/events/239716562/) Sarah Joy, who runs the study night, is awesome and walks through a new JS tutorial once a month. We're completing one of Wes Bos' #JavaScript30 videos this week. 
* [Thurs, 6/29: IoT Progressive Web Apps in Angular.](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/events/240544986/) Pretty excited about this one. We will walk through creating a simple Angular IoT application using the Kendo UI for Angular library to get started. Then we’ll see how quickly we can upgrade our application to a PWA. This workshop will be taught by Tara Manicsic (@tzmanics), a developer advocate for Progress and the Director of of Women Who Code Cincinnati. 

### Non-Tech Events: 

Promoting my usual two running meetups; if you need a crew of people to run with, come join us:

* [Portland Running Company: Thirsty Thursday 4-6 mile run @ 6:00p.](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Running-Co-Weekly-Group-Runs/events/238871360/)
* [PDX Trail Runners: Saturday at 9:00a @ Forest Park, on the Lower MacLeay Park entrance.](https://www.meetup.com/PDX-Trail-Runners/events/237741875/)

### Articles

Here are a few articles, podcasts and assorted things that I’ve enjoyed over the past week — give yourself a little mental boost on your Monday morning:

* It's project week here at Code Fellows, and I want to give a shout out to the [Spotify API, which has incredible documentation and detailed tutorials for setting up authorization routes.](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) If you're looking for a good API to play with, I highly recommend using Spotify.
* After our binary exploitation workshop last weekend, reading Antoinette Maria's article on [her first Capture the Flag security competition was a treat.](https://dev.to/_theycallmetoni/capture-the-flag-its-a-game-for-hacki-mean-security-professionals) The CTF rounds sound incredibly fun, and I love the examples that she gives for us to try.
* I've been working with MongoDB and Mongoose quite a bit lately, and enjoyed [Talk Python's episode on MongoDB applied design patterns.](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/109/mongodb-applied-design-patterns) Some of the techniques that Rick Copeland discusses were helpful when designing our database in mLab this week.
* A quick bump for [AlterConf Portland, which has just started selling tickets.](https://alterconf.com/conferences/portland-or-2017) I'm extremely grateful to Ashe Dryden and AlterConf - I won my scholarship to Code Fellows at AlterConf last year. If you're in Portland, please attend and support:
