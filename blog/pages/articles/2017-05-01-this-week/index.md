Half of my job was managing projects and people as we crafted new branding and communcations plans; the other half was moderating workshops with executive teams."

Happy Monday! I'm writing this from Akron, OH, visiting my parents and family. Yesterday, my mom and I ran the Pro Football Hall of Fame half marathon for the fifth time - it was blazing hot and dustry, but we did pretty well.

So while I'm not back on the West Coast until tonight, what's going on this week?

### Events

If you're in PDX tech:
* [Mon, 5/1: Algorithms Study Night @ Code Fellows.](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/events/238112710/) Come join us for the third Algorithms Study Night May 1st at Code Fellows! We will be working on two problems, an easier starter problem, and then a more complicated one. Any and all skill levels are welcome.
* [Wed, 5/3: DevOps Study Night @ AKQA.](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/events/238581134/) This is a continuation of the Command Line 101 Workshop @ AKQA. Once you have the foundation, we will go over DevOps command line tools and connecting them for the SysAdmin and DevOps out there.  
* [Sun, 5/7: WWC Intro to Binary Exploitations Workshop @ Galios.](https://www.meetup.com/Women-Who-Code-Portland/events/238707215/) This course peels back the layers of abstraction that normally separate you as a programmer from how your programs actually run on devices. We will go deep into detail about how computing devices work on the most fundamental levels and how knowing those details, we can leverage common errors programmers make to get their programs to do whatever we want. The workshop is mostly lecture with a detailed hands-on walkthrough of how to exploit a stack buffer overflow.

### Non-Tech Events: 

Promoting my usual two running meetups; if you need a crew of people to run with, come join us:

* [Portland Running Company: Thirsty Thursday 4-6 mile run @ 6:00p.](https://www.meetup.com/Portland-Running-Co-Weekly-Group-Runs/events/238871360/)
* [PDX Trail Runners: Saturday at 9:00a @ Forest Park, on the Lower MacLeay Park entrance.](https://www.meetup.com/PDX-Trail-Runners/events/237741875/)

### Articles

Here are a few articles, podcasts and assorted things that I’ve enjoyed over the past week — give yourself a little mental boost on your Monday morning:

* [As a bootcamp-soon-to-be-grad, I liked Kim Hart's article on what to expect after leaving your bootcamp](https://dev.to/kim_hart/5-lessons-my-bootcamp-didnt-teach-me) Her advice on making sure you're not the most senior dev in your first job, and preparing for handwritten interview questions is especially good.
* [Sarah Mei wrote a really interesting article about programming, math and her relationship with both: 'Programming Is Not Math.'](http://www.sarahmei.com/blog/2014/07/15/programming-is-not-math/) One of my favorite quotes: "Specifically, learning to program is more like learning a new language than it is like doing math problems. And the experience of programming today, in industry, is more about language than it is about math."
* A quick bump for [AlterConf Portland has just started selling tickets!](https://alterconf.com/conferences/portland-or-2017) I'm extremely grateful to Ashe Dryden and AlterConf - I won my scholarship to Code Fellows at AlterConf last year.
